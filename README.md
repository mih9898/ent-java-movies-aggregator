### Presentation Description/Overview
#### Problem
Before watching a movie many people look at rating/reviews on various resources. 
For example, I check around 2-3 resources before deciding.

1. Movies are rated very differently on various platforms(IMDb, rotted tomatoes)
2. If you check a niche-genre or subgenre usually it is better to check reviews/rating
on a special platform(e.g eastern movies-kinopoisk, anime-mal, polish movies-filmweb.pl and more).
3. Some unpopular movies often have low information(reviews, votes, etc.) on popular common source movie platforms; 
moreover, such aÂ movie could be absent.

#### Solution
A website that gathers a rating of a searched movie from different movie source platforms + general info(frames,actors, etc) + useful links(reviews)

#### Pages and functionality:
###### Index
* searchbar
* check movies
* add movies to my_list if logged
* delete movies from my_list if logged
* add a note/review regarding a moview

###### Login/Signup
* login/signup to access my movie list
