# Movies aggregator
### Presentation Description/Overview
#### Problem
Before watching a movie many people look at rating/reviews on various resources. 
For example, I check around 2-3 resources before deciding.

1. Movies are rated very differently on various platforms(IMDb, rotted tomatoes)
2. If you check a niche-genre or subgenre usually it is better to check reviews/rating
on a special platform(e.g eastern movies-kinopoisk, anime-mal, polish movies-filmweb.pl and more).
3. Some unpopular movies often have low information(revies, votes, etc.) on popular common source movie platforms; 
moreover, such aÂ movie could be absent.

#### Solution
A website that gathers a rating of searched movie from different movie source platforms
