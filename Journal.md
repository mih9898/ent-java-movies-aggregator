# Weekly Reflection

Document how my week in Ent Java went. 


### Week 1

1/27/2021 ~ 2 hours  
Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Have a rough idea how project will be working
 * Created this repository 
 * Started documenting the project journal
 
 
 ### Week 3
 
 2/7/2021 ~ 2.5 hours  
 Tasks Completed:
  * simple implementation of IMDB API
  * simple db/tables created
  * simple DAO initialized
  * movies json was parsed
  * simple search by a movie name
  * result page with movies + rating from 6 sources (provided by imdb API) 
  
   ### Week 4
   
   2/8/2021 ~ 2 hours  
   Tasks Completed:
   * simple DAO implemented  
   * simple crud (no update) is working
   * can add movies to your movie list 
   * fixed json parse (rating from int/double to string because json result had string type)
    
   2/9/2021 ~ 40 mins    
   Tasks Completed:
   * individual project checkpoint 1
   * user stories added
   * simple prototype created
   
   ### Week 5
   
   2/18/2021 - 2/20/2021 ~ 12 hours  
   Comments: 
   * In the end of the day HTML-kinopoisk-parser and limitations for imdb/kinopoisk apis  
     pushed the project to refactoring. Because of html parser search-results loaded at least 10sec;   
     in addition, limited free requests from apis were not enough for testing. That's why all implemented  
     parsers/apis were rejected fpr better ones. Fortunately, implementing new apis/parsers did not cause issues
      
   
   Tasks Completed:
   * Jumping on Spring framework
   * finishing fixing restful service
   * finishing fixing DAO
   * finishing implementing HTML-kinopoisk parser
   * switching from implemented apis/parsers to new ones
   * starting implementing kinopoisk-api
   * starting implementing imdb-api
   * Switching from HTML-kinopoisk parser, kinopoisk-api, imdb-api to omdb-api, kinopoisUnofficialApi  
      because old ones had too low free requests call limitation(100) + kinopoisk-html-parser causes speed issues

   Tasks Completed:
   * more methods on generic dao
