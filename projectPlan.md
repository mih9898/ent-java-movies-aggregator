### Week 1-2
- [x] Create project repository on GitHub
- [x] Create project structure in IntelliJ IDEA and push to repository
- [x] Link to repository from student repository
- [x] Complete problem statement
- [x] Create journal

### Week 4
- [x] Implement simple dao 
- [x] simple movies search with imdb api
- [x] adding/deleting movies to my_movie_list(wotking with 1 unnormolized table)
- [x] Add user stories with MVP indications

### Future/Current
- [X] Refactor to Spring
  - [X] connect imdb-api searching api functionality 
- [X] Write REST service (less headache with crud operations)  
  - [ ] modifty REST service that would work based on user api-key that will be autogenerated with new user
  - [ ] make it working with genericDao/Service
- [ ] Create user table
  - [ ] use Spring security as auth
  - [ ] CRUD operations that are implemented via REST service by JS or in best scenario Angular(sounds like headache)
- [X] implemented HTML-kinopoisk parser
- [X] implemented kinopoisk-api
- [X] implemented imdb-api
- [X] Connect kinopoisk api
- [ ] Switching from imdb-api, kinopoisk-api and kinopoisk-html-parser because of restricted request calls + speed
  - [X] implemenetd omdb-api
  - [X] implemented kinopoisUnofficialApi
  - [X] merging 2 apis
  - [ ] finish parser -> if omdb-api finds nothing then movie is from eastern side -> fulfill all info in Russian
- [ ] Creating unique movie id based on `imdbid.replaceAll("\D","")` + `kinopoiskid`
- [ ] Language switcher?
- [X] Delete all trashy files
- [ ] Creating view individual movie page(all details on movie)
- [ ] ASCII detection: if ASCII has Russion characters then launch only Kinopoisk-parser
  - [ ] write or user side api that will fix if user forget to switch language on a keyboard  
        `searchValue` is not rusASCII + produces nothing for imdb ->   
        converts engASCII to rusASCII -> try another time on kinopoisk-parser 
- [ ] in View display only fields that has values (conditional in view?) or js?
- [ ] unit tests(at least setup?)
  - [X] setup
  - [ ] writing tests for genericDAO
  - [ ] writing tests for JSONParser
- [ ] javadoc (at least autogenerated?)
- [ ] fix/refactor movie's searches - if movie can be found by several search values
        then `movie_search` must record it  
  
- [ ] change from sout to log4
- [ ]
